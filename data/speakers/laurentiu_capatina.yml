  I'm currently working as an SRE at PayFit on internal developer platform topics being curious about database resilience & optimisation subjects. At PayFit, we work closely with product teams on their data related issues pushing towards the adoption of performant solutions and supporting migrations out of legacy systems.

  Previously, I was part of the Mantu AI Innovation Lab first as a data scientist, next taking a role of a data engineer and afterwards becoming the system administrator in charge of building an on-premise infrastructure for AI oriented projects. Furthermore, I also acted as a promoter on GreenIT subjects participating at client facing presentations and giving internal trainings.
